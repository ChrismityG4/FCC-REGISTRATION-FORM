# REGISTRATION FORM - RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN COURSE

A simple HTML & CSS build of a registration form.  This was a real easy build as I have already learnt these codes.

There was a few new features I learnt during this build, however they are similar to the features I was already versed in so it was easily adopted.

This is the second notable proof of work from the FREE CODE CAMP COURSE â€“ RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN.
